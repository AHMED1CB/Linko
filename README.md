## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, (optionally Redux or Context)

- **WebSocket / real-time**: Socket.io (or similar)  
- **Others**: bcrypt (for password hashing), JWT (for authentication), etc.

---

## Architecture

The application follows a **clientâ€“server** architecture:

- The **client** connects to the server via HTTP for REST APIs (signup, login, fetching history) and via WebSocket for real-time messaging.  
- The **server** handles authentication, message persistence in the DB, and broadcasts real-time events to clients.  
- MongoDB stores users, chat rooms (or conversations), and message documents.
